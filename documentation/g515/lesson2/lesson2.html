<h1>
Lesson 2:&nbsp; Using theoretical times to identify teleseismic phases
with dbpick</h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%">This exercise will use the same data set we used in lesson
1.&nbsp; That is, the set of large teleseismic events recorded on the Anza
network, which you worked with before.
<p>Proceed as follows:
<ol>
<li>
The default dbpick filters are not very good for this excercise.&nbsp;

<a href="lesson2.dbpickrc">Click here</a>&nbsp; to download a file called
.dbpickrc.&nbsp; Use the&nbsp; File->save as menu item on your browser
to place this file in the directory where you put the lesson 1 dataset.&nbsp;
Save the file with the name ".dbpickrc".</li>

<li>
Start up dbpick on your copy of the database.&nbsp; There are a number
of ways to do this but for this exercise it is cleanest to do do this.&nbsp;
Enter:</li>

<ol>oe catalog
<br>fe
<p>then type
<br>ne
<p>repeatedly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a useful was to scan through the
data quickly.&nbsp; Note the association display noting event location,
distance, and azimuth information that gets spewed out in the dbpick command
window.</ol>

<li>
Zoom in/out to define a time window from just before P to a few minutes
after the S arrival.</li>

<li>
Type:&nbsp; sp basic</li>

<li>
You should now see a set of theoretical arrival times for a set of "basic"
teleseismic phases.&nbsp; They will be shown on the display with blue colored
lines with phase labels.</li>

<li>
Switch between channel groupings to see which phases are seen as coherent
arrivals across the entire array.&nbsp; That is type (without the quotes):&nbsp;&nbsp;
"sc *:BHZ"&nbsp; to look at P phases and "sc *:BHN" and "sc *:BHE" to look
at S phases.&nbsp; Make a mental or written note on which phases you think
are actually observed on which channels.&nbsp; Experiment with the filters
on the Filter menu.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many phases are only seen well at long
periods while a few are more "broadband".&nbsp; (Explore this yourself
and report your results next time.&nbsp; Consider why this is true and
come prepared to discuss it.)</li>

<li>
You might want to be more specific and type things like:&nbsp; sp ScS.&nbsp;
This would bring up the theoretical time only for ScS.</li>

<li>
When you have a phase you think is real you can pick it.&nbsp; A feature
of dbpick, however, is that unless the phase is a simple phase name like
P or S, you need to force the pick to be called something else.&nbsp; e.g.
if you want to pick ScS type:&nbsp; ph ScS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then pick
the arrivals as you did last week for picking P.&nbsp; When you point and
click the flag will appear with ScS instead of the default of U.</li>

<li>
Use snapshot to make a hard copy of your results to bring to next weeks
class for discussion.</li>

<li>
Draw a ray diagram showing what each of the phases you interpreted represent.&nbsp;
This will help in the discussion to remind people what those obscure names
mean.</li>

<li>
Are there any other interesting features you see in the event you analyze
and/or one of the phases you picked?</li>
</ol>
