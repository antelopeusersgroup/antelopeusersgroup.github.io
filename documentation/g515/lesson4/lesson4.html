<P>1.  Find data from a large (magnitude &gt; 6.5), shallow (z&lt;50km) earthquake recorded by
the GSN.  Steal from a fellow student or go download something from the IRIS DMC.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>2.  Find a station with good surface wave signals on the Z component and make a hard
copy of this seismogram.  (The window should, of course, be focused on teh surface
waves.)</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>3.  Get distance from the output of the "ae" command in dbpick run on this event. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>4.  Measure the 1/2 period at 4 to 10 points in the surface wave train, convert these
numbers to group velocities, and make a plot of group velocity versus T.  Does this agree
with standard chart attached? </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Be prepared to discuss your results and the answers to these questions next week. </P>
