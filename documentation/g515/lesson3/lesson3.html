G515:&nbsp; Lesson 3</h1></center>

<center>Accessing Data from IRIS DMC</center>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><i>Objective:</i>
<br>This lesson will teach you steps required to download data from the
IRIS Data Management Center through the interface they call "Wilber" and
convert the download file into a form you can work with using the Antelope
processing programs.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><i>Follow these steps:</i>
<ol>
<li>
Go to the&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.iris.washington.edu">IRIS DMC
WEB SITE</a></li>

<li>
On the left Frame labeled <b>Quick Links</b> there is a link with the lable
<b>Wilber</b>.&nbsp;
Follow that link</li>

<li>
Follow the links on the right side of the page that comes up to use "Wilber
II, son of Wilber"&nbsp; (You may want to bookmark this page when it comes
up to avoid this path later)</li>

<li>
Select a quarter (Q1, Q2, etc.) and a year.&nbsp; Newer data has "Spyder"
events, which means they were downloaded shortly after they occurred and
have not been quality controlled.&nbsp; If you look at data more than about
1 year old, the Spyder data are gone because they are superceded by "Farm"
events (higher quality)&nbsp; You will get a display something like this:<img SRC="wilber_page.gif" height=712 width=850 align=TEXTTOP></li>

<li>
Point at a region of earthquakes with your mouse and left click with your
mouse.&nbsp; You will get a list of events within the specified "Selection
Radius".&nbsp; Experiment with the "Selection Radius" widget varying the
search radius and area you select to get the feel for this interface.</li>

<li>
Select an event from the list by clicking on the date field</li>

<li>
A list of network codes comes up that describes different groups of stations
run by different groups.&nbsp; Select II and IU under the IRIS GSN/GDSN
group and click <b>Proceed</b></li>

<li>
A lengthy form comes up.&nbsp; It would be a good idea to print this page
for later reference now.</li>

<li>
Note that the form is divided into two parts:&nbsp; (1) station codes,
and (2) channel codes.&nbsp; You can use this to select from 1 to hundreds
of channels of recordings of the event you have selected.&nbsp; For now
choose <font color="#FF0000">ALL</font><font color="#000000"> stations
and only the </font><font color="#FF0000">L </font><font color="#000000">channels
(fyi, the codes are this:&nbsp; B - broadband, L - long period, S-short
period, H - high frequency broadband, and E - triggered short period data.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wilber normally has only B, L, and S channels.&nbsp;&nbsp; The second letter
is normally an H and the third letter in the code defines the orientation
of the sensor: Z=vertical, N=north-south, and E=east-west).</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">While you are here push the button labelled <u>Map
of Responding Stations</u>.&nbsp; Try to print this image (The way to do
this is browser and system dependent so the keyword is "try".&nbsp; It
would be useful to have this picture next week when we discuss the event
you chose.)</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Fill in the <b>Personal Information </b>typein fields
in the lower right part of the page and check the <b>Notify me by email
when complete </b>field.&nbsp; Then push the <b>Process Request</b> button
(you are selecting the default data format which is called "SEED" for Standard
Earthquake Exchange Data).</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">A page comes up showing where you are in the queue
for getting the data you requested.&nbsp; You can sit and wait for it to
tell you it is finished, or wait until it send you email to tell you were
to find the data.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Grab the data from iris by anonymous ftp.&nbsp; You
can use command line ftp to ftp.iris.washington.edu or a web browser pointing
at&nbsp;</font> <a href="ftp://www.iris.washington.edu/pub/userdata">ftp://www.iris.washington.edu/pub/userdata</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
You should find your data in a directory under the name you&nbsp; typed
as your <b>Personal Information</b> earlier.&nbsp; Be aware this file can
easily get pretty large and could exceed your file quota on nations.&nbsp;
You should probably place it in the /scratch area to prevent a quota violation
in the download process (I assume you all have done enough web work to
know how to do this.)</li>

<li>
When the file is completely transferred run the program called <b>psd2db</b>.&nbsp;
First read the output from "man psd2db" to see the full usage of this command.&nbsp;
(Note I have seen psd2db fail on DMC generated SEED files.&nbsp; If something
goes wrong, try sd2db.&nbsp; The former is nicer to use because it does
not require making a second copy or the data.&nbsp; The later can generate
a large number of files that can be overwhelming.</li>

<li>
Run dbpick on the output "database" and play with the data a bit.&nbsp;
Some things to experiment with are:</li>

<ul>
<li>
The data display can be too messy to see anything and be slow to display.&nbsp;
Use the sc command to limit the data you see.&nbsp; It can be useful to
use the page from the Wilber form you printed earlier to select stations
that might be of more interest.</li>

<li>
Use the oe, ae, and sp commands to bring up theoretical phase picks.</li>

<li>
Try selecting one component (e.g. sc *:BHZ) in combination with the "rec"
command.&nbsp; This brings up a display of the events in distance order.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Print what you get from this.</li>

<li>
Try the "pal on" command.&nbsp; This aligns the data on the theoretical
P wave arrival time (ae has to be successful for this to work at all).&nbsp;
Zoom into the P wave and print what you get (use BHZ channels for this,
why?)</li>

<li>
Bring the hard copies with you next week for discussion by the class.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
