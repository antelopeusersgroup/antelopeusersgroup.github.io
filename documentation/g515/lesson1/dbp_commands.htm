<h3>
Common commands typed in a terminal window to control dbpick</h3>
(This list is not complete.&nbsp; See man page for more complete list.)
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
sc</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>Mnemonic for "Station Channel" select.&nbsp; Sta and chan field are
separated by the : character.&nbsp; Can be a comma separated list or use
unix regular expression wildcarding.&nbsp; Examples:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>sc AAK:BHZ,ULHL:BHZ,EKS:BHZ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; selects
vertical (Z) broadband (B) channels for AAK, ULHL, and EKS
<br>sc *:EHZ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; select all stations with an EHZ channel
<br>sc *:.HZ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; select all vertical channels from all stations
<br>sc ANMO:*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; select all channels from station ANMO</blockquote>
Note:&nbsp; most digital data today is stored using SEED conventions for
station-channel codes. The only one's I've seen are: LH - long period,
BH -"Broadband", HH - triggered "broadband", SH - "short period", EH -&nbsp;
triggered high frequency channels
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
ts timestring</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>Sets Time Start (i.e. the absolute time at the left side of the seismogram
display) to the time defined by the "timestring" .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
time string format should follow that seen on the graphics window.&nbsp;
Example:
<blockquote>ts 1999020:19:20:00.0</blockquote>
sets the start time to day 20 of 1999 at 19:20:00.0 .
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
tw width</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>Set the default number of seconds of data to display to "width".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Example:
<blockquote>tw 600</blockquote>
will display 10 minutes of data whenever the display jumps.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Note that zoom in and out operations supercede this setting.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
oe and ae commands</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>These two commands are nearly always used together.&nbsp; "oe" is mnemonic
for Open Event database and "ae" is mnemonic for Associate Event.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
oe is always issued first to "open" and event data based.&nbsp; For example:
<blockquote>oe /p/data/db/tables/reb/reb/1997</blockquote>
tries open a css3.0 database containing an origin and event table named
"1997" in the directory /p/data/db/tables/reb/reb.&nbsp; This command need
only be typed once per run of dbpick.&nbsp; The database is normally kept
"open" until dbpick exits.
<p>The ae command is then used to associate picked phases to the list of
events in the database defined with the oe command.&nbsp; At least one
pick must be made on the seismograms visible in the main graphics window
for this command to work, but picks not actually displayed will be associated
with the arrivals.&nbsp;&nbsp; ae produces a lot of output when it is successful
and gives information on distance and azimuth to each station.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you have write permission in the database you can issue the wa command
to save a set of rows in the assoc table, but this is usually done better
with a related package called dbloc2.
<h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">rec</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>Orders data in a "record section format" meaning traces are arranged
in order of increasing distance, although not scaled to any uniform distance
scale. Note this&nbsp; requires&nbsp; running the ae command on the visible
data first so the program can sort out the correct order.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
sfit</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>Forces all the traces to fit in this window (Bad idea when the number
of traces is greater than about 30).
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
tfit</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>"time fit". Time scale is adjusted to display full waveform segment
(Useful for some segmented data, bad idea for most continuous data).
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
ps file</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>Writes a postscript image of what is on the screen right now to "file".
(For example: ps peru.ps)&nbsp; Note the pick flags are not printed.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
sa on/off</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>Turns the display of arrival flags on and off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Common
use is to remove clutter when a large number of arrivals are picked or
a large number of traces are displayed.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
soa on/off</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>Toggles the "overlay arrivals" on and off.&nbsp; Overlay arrivals are
theoretical arrival times based on the origin associated with a set of
picks and an iaspei91 earth model that are displayed as lines with a label.&nbsp;
Has no effect unless oe and ae had been typed earlier.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
sp list</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>Controls the list of "overlay arrivals" displayed.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
list is a comma separated list of phase names to be displayed.&nbsp; Examples:
<blockquote>sp P,S,PP,SS&nbsp;&nbsp; - display theoretical times for P,
S, PP, and SS phases
<br>sp basic - display a set of predicted arrival times for a set of "standard"
phases.</blockquote>
