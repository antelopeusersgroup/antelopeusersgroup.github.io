<P>Take the event you all downloaded from IRIS a few weeks ago.  Complete the following:</P>

<P>1.	Make a record section display of your data and print it.  Do this for both B and L
channels if you have them.  </P>

<P>2.	Pick one or more stations and go through the following sequence of steps:</P>

<P>	a.	Treat this seismogram like one of the analog records we have been looking
at and mark a series of protoarrivals on the record that you think look like
distinct arrivals.  Use the "U" default flag for ph</P>

<P>	b.	Run the oe and ae commands to get an association (you did this before to
have made the record section)</P>

<P>	c.	Use the sp command to help you identify which phases seem to correlate
with one's you picked.  Use the ph labelling command to add a new pick (on
top of your previous one if necessary) that marks associated phases based on
the predicted arrival time shown by sp</P>

<P>3.	We will look at all your examples in record reading next week on the computer.  It
turns out that dbpick doesn't print arrival flags, or at least I've not learned of any
undocumented feature that does allow this.</P>
