<p><b><font face="Palatino"><font size=+0>The Geyokcha Array</font></font></b>
<p>The Geyokcha array, located near the Iran-Turkmenistan border <a href="fig-01.gif">(Geyokcha
regional map)</a> , is an array of broadband &amp; short-period seismographs
deployed during 1993-94, as part of the IRIS-supported US-Soviet Joint
Seismic Program. The array is located near the Kopet Dagh fault zone, marking
the southern edge of the Eurasian Plate <a href="fig-02.gif">(Array detail)</a>
. There are a wide variety of local, regional, and teleseismic events recorded
by the array, as well as a number of quarry and mining blasts. The array
consists of nine three-component broadband stations and 36 short-period
sensors&nbsp; <a href="fig-02.gif">(Array detail)</a> . For this exercise,
we will be using only the broadband records. We will be using a segment
of the array data from late 1993 through early 1994.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The Array Processing Software</b>
<p>We will be using a number of array-processing programs developed by
Danny Harvey at University of Colorado, who is now present of BRTT, the
company that sells and maintains Antelope. The processes are conveniently
controlled through a GUI interface, called process_array , that is a tcl/tk
script written originally Danny and modified some by G. Pavlis. From this
script, we can run dbpick, to examine the orginal seismic data,
dbap, to
run the array processor, fk_script, to compute and display azimuth-slowness
plots, st_script, to compute and display slowness-time plots, bm_script,
to compute and display the array beams, and wr_script, to write the beams
to disk. The GUI interface is a convenient way to control these subprocesses,
and to display the array processing information on the screen.
<p>To set yourself up to begin this exercise do the following:
<ol>
<li>
Create a working directory to contain the data files for this exercise
and cd to that directory.&nbsp; Be warned this file is fairly large (30+
Mbytes when uncompressed) so be sure you have space available to hold the
data.</li>

<li>
Download the file.&nbsp; Just&nbsp; <a href="http://geology.indiana.edu/pavlis/g515data/array_exercise.tar.gz">click
here</a>&nbsp; to do this through your browser.

<li>
Assuming the current directory is the one you downloaded this file into,
you need to uncompress the file with: gunzip array_exercise.tar.gz</li>

<li>
Run tar to extract all the files contained in the tarball holding all the
stuff you need:&nbsp;&nbsp; tar xvf array_exercise.tar</li>

<li>
You should now have a working database with everything in order.&nbsp;
Just type:&nbsp; process_array</li>

<li>
The following control panel should appear:</li>
</ol>
<img SRC="dbap_controlpanel.gif" height=720 width=894>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Note that the display shows the data being used for this exercise (gey)
and the central reference station of the array (ORGH). The central portion
of the interface shows a number of filter settings that we can use for
calculating the array beams. The bottom of the display includes the buttons
that control the sub-processes listed above.
<p>(3) Start dbpick and dbap using the GUI interface buttons.
<p>A dbpick window will open up, as well as two small xterm windows controlling
dbpick and dbap. You might have to work a little to arrange the windows
in some workable format.
<p>(4) From the dbpick window, select one 3-component station to examine
waveforms
<p>sc ORGH:*
<p>(later, if you want to examine all of the broadband verticals, you can
display them using the command
<p>sc *:HHZ,
<p>or the short-period verticals, using
<p>sc *:EHZ.
<p>(5) Enable time fit to maximize the dbpick window
<p>tfit
<p>(6) Pick inital P-wave and S-wave arrivals, using the dbpick commands
"Pick Arrivals" (See Gary's dbpick notes). Use filters as necessary to
help identify phases--higher frequency for local events; lower frequencies
for regional events and teleseisms.
<p>(7) Run the azimuth-slowness script using the FK button on the process_array
interface. A dbap display will open up, with "radar-screen" diagrams showing
coherence as a function of azimuth and slowness. [Note: circles are at
increments of 0.1 sec/km in slowness, and therefore non-linear in velocity].
Look for focused directions of energy arrival, reasonable apparent velocities,
and agreement between P and S arrival directions. Repeat picks and/or filters
as necessary to get coherent arrivals.
<p>(8) Run the slowness-time script using the ST button on the process_array
interface. Three plots showing slowness as a function of time in the vertical,
radial, and transverse directions will appear, with a display of the reference
station data (filtered) and beam data (filtered) for the best-fit arrival
direction. Look for coherent arrivals around the P and S times. Repick
arrivals and repeat (6) - (8) as necessary.
<p>(9) Examine the beams using the BEAM button on the process_array interface.
The display will show 12 traces (4 each for vertical, radial, and transverse).
In each group, the top one shows filtered data for the reference station,
filtered data for the beam, unfiltered data for the reference station,
and unfiltered beam data.
<p>(10) If you wish to save the beam data, use the WRITE button on the
process_array
interface. Caution: You may only do this ONCE for each event. If you try
to write over pre-existing beam traces, the program will crash! Do not
write unless you're sure that you've got your final beam traces!
<p>(11) If you wish to make hard copies, you must edit the script fk_script,
located in your g515 directory. Find the line
<p>set psfile none
<p>and change the "none" to a file name (e.g., plot.ps). The next time
you run FK or ST, the program will write a parallel copy to disk as a postscript
file, which can be printed directly. The file will be wiped out the next
time you run the script. To run more efficiently, return the filename to
"none" when you are done printing. If you have trouble getting a clear
output on the color printer, you may want to try the unix command
<p>setenv GRX_GAMMA 2.0
<p>to get a better color map to the printer.
<p>(12) To seek associations with earthquake tables, use the commands
<p>oe /p/data/db/pde/pde_1993 or pde_1994
<p>to open the event data base, and
<p>ae
<p>to seek an event associated with your picks. Note that at least one
pick must be made before running this command.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Your Assignment</b>
<p>Process all the events you find in this database.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the
array azimuth estimates and S-P times to get location estimates of each
event.&nbsp; We'll have a more precise catalog estimate at that time to
compare what a computer program got to your rough solution.&nbsp; Some
additional things to focus on are:
<ol>
<li>
The events in this set&nbsp; span a range of distances from very close
(I get ~ 5 km) to near teleseismic distances.&nbsp; What differences do
you see in the kinds of waveforms you see at different distances?</li>

<li>
Try to use the array to help identify Pn, Pg, Sn, and Lg when this is appropriate.</li>

<li>
On the regional events, once you have picks of some of the regional phases
investigate the frequency dependence of the different phases and their
"character" and report on this to the rest of the group.</li>
</ol>
