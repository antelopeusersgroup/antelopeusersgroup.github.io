<hr WIDTH="100%">Velocity Model Database Extension Tables</h1></center>

<center>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></center>
Genloc uses two extension tables of the css3.0 schema to define&nbsp; velocity
models called <i>mod1d</i> and <i>ttcalc .</i>&nbsp; The contents of each
of these tables is described in detail here.
<h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><i>ttcalc </i>table</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>Each travel time calculator that expect to access the velocity model
database is expected to register it's existence in this table.&nbsp; Consequently
this table is normally only edited by a developer who wants to add a new
travel time calculator to the generic tt interface.&nbsp; Here is the current
table viewed with dbe:
<br><img SRC="ttcalc.gif" height=175 width=310>
<br>The algorithm name is used to reference a travel time method by name.&nbsp;
The libname attribute defines the name of the shared library used by the
generic tt interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The actual name is generated by
prepending a "lib" prefix to the libname attribute.&nbsp; For example,
for libname=tttaup the shared object tt actually search for will be called
libtttaup.so.
<p>ttentry and uentry give the actual entry point names for the travel
time and slowness vector calculators in this shared object.
<h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><i>mod1d </i>table</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>The mod1d table is designed to hold data that defines any earth model
that can be specified as a function of depth alone.&nbsp; Here&nbsp; is
a dbe view of a sample mod1d table.
<p><img SRC="mod1d.gif" height=319 width=700>
<p>Models are given a name defined by the <i>modname</i> attribute that
should be used by travel time calculators to match the model name input
to the generic travel time calculator interface (see tt(3)).&nbsp; <i>paramname
</i>refers to the physical property being defined for this model name and
<i>units</i> give the physical units of that quantity.&nbsp; The actual
values assigned to the model at a given depth are determined from the <i>depth</i>,
<i>paramval</i>, and <i>grad</i> attributes.&nbsp; The <i>depth </i>attribute
defines the depth (in km) in the earth at which the property <i>paramname
</i>takes on the value <i>paramval</i>.&nbsp; The <i>grad</i> attribute
defines the gradient in <i>units/</i>km of this property below the grid
point depth.&nbsp; This can be used to define models made up of piecewise
linear segments or with constant velocity layers by setting grad=0 everywhere.
<h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><i>regmodel </i>and <i>regions </i>tables</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>These two tables are interlinked and between themselves and with the
<i>mod1d</i> calculator.&nbsp; They are used by the ttregions calculator
to allow the use of different models and different travel time calculators
in different locations within a network.&nbsp; Here are examples of both
viewd by dbe:
<br><img SRC="regmodel.gif" height=191 width=469>
<br><img SRC="regions.gif" height=543 width=419>
<br>The <i>regmodel </i>table defines which travel time calculator and
velocity model are to be used for a given region name (attribute <i>regname</i>).&nbsp;
The <i>regions</i> table defines polygonal regions as a series of latitude-longitude
pairs that define polygonal regions (in clockwise order).
