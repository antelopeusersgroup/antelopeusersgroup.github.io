	<p>Antelope (TM) is a software package for real-time seismic network data
	acquisition and processing. It is a commercial software package with roots
	in the academic seismology community. <a href="http://brtt.com/">Boulder
		Real Time Technology (BRTT)</a> is the commercial vendor for the
	package. The Antelope Users Group is a community of scientists who are
	using Antelope for real-time data acquisition and/or processing. The
	organizers of the Antelope Users Group are not employees of BRTT, but
	rather are end-users of Antelope software.</p>

	<p>Some members of the AUG actively develop new software modules that
	utilize Antelope as a framework. We exchange updates through the <a
		href="https://github.com/antelopeusersgroup/antelope_contrib">antelope_contrib
		Github repository</a> that allows developers at different institutions
	to collaborate on code. If you are developing software for Antelope and
	wish to become actively involved in this exchange, please visit our GitHub
	repository. The <a
		href="https://github.com/antelopeusersgroup/antelope_contrib/blob/master/README.md">README
		for antelope_contrib</a> contains instructions for how to contribute
	code.</p>

	<p>There is a <a
		href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/antelope-users-group">mailing
		list for the Antelope Users Group</a> hosted at Google Groups. This is
	a great way to get help with using Antelope from the community.</p>
